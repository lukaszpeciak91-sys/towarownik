# Decisions

The following decisions are approved for V0.1:

- Build a native Android application using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
- Use package and application ID `pl.lukaszpeciak.towarownik`.
- Use no backend.
- Provide one unified search field.
- Automatically detect a 7-digit OBIK product code, EAN, or product name.
- Return at most five results for text searches.
- Use store number `075` in Nowy Sącz as the default store.
- Focus a result on product name, exact local stock, local store price, and an external product link.
- When local stock is zero, later check a bounded number of nearby stores.
- Do not include product images.
- Do not include user accounts.
- Do not include analytics.
- Do not include AI in V0.1.
- Support portrait and landscape orientations.
- Use neutral Towarownik branding with no retailer branding.
- Validate through local APK testing first, followed by Google Play Internal Testing.

These decisions describe intended product behavior. The bootstrap does not implement search, networking, parsing, store availability, or final UI behavior.
